# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Stabilize and polish the visionOS SSH terminal UX.
- Finalize terminal window composition boundaries:
  - frame chrome stays system-like/stable
  - display/translucency controls apply to terminal pane only
- Keep global settings global and move session-specific controls into terminal-local context.
- Keep README/docs aligned with currently shipped capabilities.
- Maintain clean repo structure for public open-source collaboration.

## Immediate Priorities
- Continue PR-based workflow on protected `main`.
- Validate final tuning of terminal-local settings modal contrast/legibility under different room backgrounds.
- Keep app-source folder free of ad-hoc task markdown docs.
