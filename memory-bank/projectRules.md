# Project Rules

## Code and Structure
- Prefer incremental edits over large rewrites.
- Keep implementation docs in root README and memory bank, not mixed into runtime source folders.
- Keep local machine artifacts out of commits (`xcuserdata`, build state, etc.).

## Collaboration
- Use PR-first workflow for all non-trivial changes.
- Keep branch naming with `codex/` prefix for feature branches.

## Documentation Tone and Status Labeling
- Use neutral, operational language in memory-bank files.
- Avoid alarm-style emoji markers and high-intensity wording in persistent docs.
- Label archived notes as historical records and keep current status in `README.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
