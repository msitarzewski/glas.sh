# Historical Task Record: SSH Implementation Milestone

## Historical Context
This document captured an early “SSH implementation complete” milestone during initial integration work.

## Milestone Achievements Recorded
- SSH dependency integration via Citadel-based flow.
- Terminal session integration for connect/disconnect and command transport.
- PTY shell session establishment and streaming output path.

## Migration-Era Instructions (Archived)
The original version included step-by-step setup and validation instructions intended for that specific point in time.

## Historical Backlog Snapshot
The original note included backlog entries for:
- SSH key authentication
- SSH agent support
- ANSI escape handling

Those backlog entries are archival. Current shipped capability should be determined from:
- `/Users/michael/Developer/glas.sh/README.md`
- `/Users/michael/Developer/glas.sh/memory-bank/activeContext.md`
- `/Users/michael/Developer/glas.sh/memory-bank/progress.md`

## Current Interpretation
This file is retained as a milestone artifact and is not the canonical source for current feature completeness.
