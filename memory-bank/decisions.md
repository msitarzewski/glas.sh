## 2026-02-07: Adopt memory-bank structure from AGENTS.md
- Status: Approved
- Context: Project needed durable, structured context and task history outside runtime app source.
- Decision: Create `memory-bank/` core files and move legacy markdown task docs into dated monthly task records.
- Consequences: Cleaner source tree, better continuity for future AI/human sessions, explicit task history location.
